## üöÄ Getting Started

  - **üì¶ Installation**
     - Clone the repository:
       
       ```
       git clone https://github.com/Ronit-06/Task-Management-API.git
       cd Task-Management-API
       ```
       
    - Install dependencies:
      
      ```
      npm install
      ```
      
    - Set up environment variables:
      - Create a .env.development.local file in the root directory and add the following:
        
      ```
      PORT=4000
      MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
      JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
      REDIS_HOST=your_redis_public_endpoint
      REDIS_PORT=12570
      REDIS_USERNAME = "default" 
      REDIS_PASSWORD = your_redis_cloud_password
      ARCJET_API_KEY=your_arcjet_api_key
      ARCJET_ENV = development
      EMAIL = your_email@email.com
      EMAIL_PASSWORD = your_email_app_key
      ```
    - Start the development server:

      ```
      npm run dev
      ```
      
    - Start redis in a seperate terminal:
   
      ```
      npm run start:worker
      ```
      
  - **Usage:**
    - Authentication
      - Register a new user via POST /api/auth/signup.
      - Log in with POST /api/auth/login with the awt token recived from the signup.
    - Task Management
      - Create tasks with POST /api/tasks
      - Update tasks using PUT /api/tasks/:id
      - Delete tasks with DELETE /api/tasks/:id
      - Add comments to tasks via POST /api/tasks/:id/comments
    - Reminder Emails
        - Reminder emails are sent based on task schedules using Redis and Bull queues.
        - Monitored on Redis Cloud.
    -  Security Features
        - Bot protection and rate limiting are enforced via Arcjet middleware.
        - Monitored on Arcjet Dashboard.
      
## üë®‚Äçüíª Developer Notes 

- This project is my attempt at building a production-ready API from scratch.
  
- **Some key points from my journey:**
  - This is my first time implementing Redis and Bull for background jobs and scheduled tasks. I learned how queues help scale features like reminder emails without blocking        the main API flow.
  - It‚Äôs also my first time making a complete API from scratch, handling everything from user auth to task logic, security middleware, and error handling.
  - I focused on using industry practices like JWT authentication, password hashing, middleware-based architecture, and structured logging to make the project closer to real-       world production APIs.
  - I explored Arcjet for bot protection, rate limiting, and token bucket security ‚Äî something I hadn‚Äôt used before, but it gave me hands-on experience with API hardening.
  - I also enforced code quality with ESLint, ensuring consistent formatting and adherence to best practices, which helped me maintain a clean and professional codebase.
  - Overall, this project was a way for me to explore scalable backend design and build something practical enough to be deployed in a real-world scenario.
